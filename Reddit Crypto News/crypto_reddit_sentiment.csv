I have little doubt that Bitcoin will rise higher, but TA is never a guarantee. There's always too many unknown variables in crypto
---
tldr; Bitcoin surged above $119,000, nearing $120,000, as it rebounded from two-week lows around $114,500. Analysts highlighted key levels, with $119.5K and $120K as critical resistance points for further upward movement. Liquidation clusters and exchange order-book liquidity suggest potential price swings between $113.6K and $121K. Market participants anticipate heightened volatility, with short liquidations potentially exceeding $1.1 billion if Bitcoin challenges its all-time high near $123,000.

tldr; MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has hinted at potential new Bitcoin purchases, referencing a chart from SaylorTracker that historically signals buying activity. The company, which holds over 4,387 BTC worth $71.85 billion, has seen a 64% unrealized gain on its investments. Recent acquisitions include $739 million in Bitcoin funded by a $2 billion preferred stock offering. Saylor advocates Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a corporate treasury reserve, though the strategy's reliance on leverage raises investor concerns about short-term risks.

tldr; The GENIUS Act, recently passed in the U.S., aims to reshape the stablecoin landscape by separating interest-bearing stablecoins from payment-focused ones. This regulatory clarity is expected to drive innovation in payment services and 'killer apps,' with companies like Mastercard, PayPal, and Polygon exploring new use cases such as cross-border payments and micropayments. The act aligns U.S. regulations closer to the EU's MiCA framework and emphasizes utility over yield, fostering adoption in real-world commerce and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Despite past challenges, including leadership changes and competition from blockchains like Solana, Ethereum's technological contributions and institutional investments signal long-term success.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs account for 40% of recent price swings, with $54.66 billion in purchases boosting Bitcoin from $45,000 to $123,000.

---
Not exactly a bold bet - the *actual* statement is 

> Citigroup has released a new forecast projecting Bitcoin to reach $135,000 by the end of 2025 in its base-case scenario. The bullish case estimates a potential rise to $199,000, while the bearish outlook places the cryptocurrency at $64,000. The forecast is driven by three key factors: institutional demand via spot Bitcoin ETFs, user adoption growth, and macroeconomic conditions. Citi analysts estimate that ETF inflows alone now account for over 40% of Bitcoin’s price variation, with an expected $15 billion in additional ETF investments potentially adding $63,000 to the asset’s valuation. The report reflects Bitcoin’s increasing integration into traditional finance and highlights ETF demand as the dominant driver of its price trajectory.

While it's overall not unreasonable analysis staking out a range from $64,000 to $199,000 seems pretty un-bold to me.

tldr; Ethereum's price is approaching a critical resistance level at $4,100, driven by strong institutional interest and $5.1 billion in spot ETF inflows this month. Ethereum dominates key crypto sectors like NFTs, DeFi, and tokenized assets, with its total value locked reaching $186 billion. Technical patterns, including an inverse head-and-shoulders on the weekly chart, suggest a potential breakout to $4,000 and beyond, possibly reaching $5,000. BlackRock and Fidelity lead the ETF inflows, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum's market position.

He believes rate cuts would boost housing affordability, reduce inflation, and support economic growth. Rieder also highlighted the transformative potential of AI and crypto, emphasizing stablecoins' role in the future financial system and global crypto adoption as a growing economic force.

For security, use a Trezor with a seedphrase + passphrase. The passphrase is not kept into your Trezor, so nobody will ever retrieve it that way if you're scared about a malicious person having a physical access to your device.

No, with Ledger you won't ever be sure there's no backdoor. The company f..ed up their clients a few times already, they have not much left to lose if they introduce/d a backdoor at this point. Truth to be told, most people do not care an iota about their privacy and being the sole owners of their coins. They would happily totally sacrifice these for a little commodity.

Trezor lacks of support of many ""good"" coins is annoying, for sure, there's no question about that.

---
Realistically, it can't... yet.  When it comes to crypto value, people don't consider the market cap.  For BTC to hit $1M, that would mean the market cap would be $21T, which is more than gold.  That's unrealistic right now.  But it could happen over time. And it might only take a dozen years or so.  But the other reason that BTC goes up is when the dollar goes down.  Like gold, BTC is inflation-proof.  So if the dollar collapses to the point where BTC is $1M then your buying power would still be the same. For example, if the dollar's value today crashes to the buying power of a dime, BTC would be worth $1M, but you'd still only be able to buy $100k worth of stuff. 


This is why people who thought Shiba could hit a dollar were crazy.  For SHIB to hit one dollar, the market cap would be 4x more than all the money on Earth.  It's ridiculous.  


Bitcoin has a 4-year cycle. We're approaching the FOMO ATH cycle now.  This will eventually top out maybe around $140k or so, give or take.  Then it will drop to around $70k by late 2026. 


I already took my profits this cycle so I am hodl until 2029 after the Spring of 2028 halving event.  I paid off my mortgage with it, so I'm happy.  The next cycle, I build a new house.  Does that mean it's gonna suck when I lose $50k of my portfolio next year?  Sure.  But I've been through it twice now.  I play the long game and the cycle.  When everyone is crying and saying BTC is done in 2026, I'll be scooping up more in preparation for the next ATH.  


$1M BTC in 2025? No chance.  2029?  Unlikely.   2033?  Maybe!

CryptoCurrency,Creating a Monthly Investment in Crypto,"So recently decided to just set up an automated investment into the crypto market as part of my overall financial portfolio. I assume it would be best to diversify amongst various coins, but should also be in coins that show the best possible long term returns. Below is my breakdown- is this the right breakdown?

BTC - 40%
ETH - 25%
LINK - 15%
SOL - 10%
XRP - 10%

To be honest I don’t have much of a thought process on these other than they seem to have the highest upside for adoption by current real world institutions and assets. Obviously BTC effectively being the gold standard of the cryptocurrency market is why it will hold such a high percentage.

My intent is to just make an investment once a month, and just let this ride out for 5-10 years depending on where life has me at that time.

This surge is driven by Ethereum's rising price, growing popularity of ETH ETFs, and the passage of the GENIUS Act stablecoin bill. BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust led the charge, reaching $10 billion in assets in record time. Experts suggest ETH ETFs will continue to perform well short-term, though Bitcoin ETFs may regain momentum later in the year.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Bitcoin,God Candle painting,"Hey guys! Another Bitcoin painting in the streets for the first to take it home. 
This painting represents more than price action. It represents an awakening. The sense that something new and inevitable is rising non stop, not by force, but by consensus.
I chose to leave this piece at the Cristo Rei because it stands as a powerful symbol of faith. For a long time, I struggled with religion. I rejected it. But today, I no longer fight it. I’ve made peace with it. I respect those who believe, and I acknowledge the transformative power that faith can have, even if I don’t fully share it nor understand it. Hope you like it.

It is insane. I think about this a lot. 

Everyone here has forgotten a password before. Everyone here has needed to reverse a transaction before.

With Bitcoin, there is ZERO tolerance for error. Yes, that’s what makes it secure. And yes, that’s what makes it unrealistic for many people to own. They want the ‘fraud protection’. 

We’ve all been there before. I’m hoping there’s a way in the future to maintain this security and decentralization while allowing SOME reversibility. Honestly, it’ll increase adoption and become even more valuable.

---
Same if you had cash and it’s lost, stolen or burned up. It breeds personal responsibility.
---
Not insane… That’s the whole point of a decentralized system. 

It’s also not erased as the ledger holds the record of your transactions $.. it’s just stuck on the blockchain without a key.

It’s a whole lot better to rely on yourself than to rely on banks, people, or services to hold onto YOUR money. 
What stops banks, people or services from going under or getting hacked or having their data wiped? That can’t happen with blockchain and you are solely responsible. No one to blame, no one to ask when you need access to your money.
---
This is why you have your back up words. If you lose those as well, use anchor watch or a similar service. If you fuck that up, well, thanks for the donation 😂. Also Bitcoin fuctions this way because it's the one asset you can truly, beyond a reason of doubt, own. This is not so for all other assets.

I’d argue the value isn’t lost; the value of lost coins is transferred to all the other coins in circulation when supply is restricted.

Bitcoin,"Crypto… too late, or too early?","Hi all,

Forgive my naivety — I’m very new to the world of crypto.

To be honest, I’ve always been a bit put off by how cryptocurrencies are portrayed in mainstream media — as incredibly risky, volatile, and at times even scam-adjacent. That reputation kept me on the sidelines for years.

But after finally doing some of my own research, I can’t help but feel like I’ve been missing out. I’ve recently invested a small amount just to test the waters, but I’m holding off on putting more in for now — partly because I’m still learning, and partly because I’m wondering if there might be a better time to go deeper.

So I guess my question to this community is:
Have I missed the boat… or is this still the early innings of something much bigger?

Would love to hear your honest takes, especially from those who’ve been in the space a while.

Thanks in advance!

>Have I missed the boat… or is this still the early innings of something much bigger?


Congrats on the move, it's never too late, [despite new people thinking otherwise](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rskpuf/i_have_only_600_bitcoinsi_missed_the_bus/). ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Now, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill 

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. 

You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

Also, [check the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about) that's filled with lots of great info and if you have any questions, visit r/BitcoinBeginners or r/Bitcoin and look for the answers.

You gotta have a long term outlook. For this cycle I’d say we are well past the 6th inning. Long term, Bitcoin will return over 10x from here and more. Just gotta keep buying and holding.

Bitcoin only. Crypto IS the scam-adjacent part of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the winner-takes-all and thus you are far from late, countries and big institutions haven't even begun scrambling yet.

Bitcoin,How can I access BTC in a very old Blockchain.info wallet? I have the backup phrase and login ID,"Over a decade ago I made a small experiment with Bitcoin. I created a wallet on Blockchain and converted a bit of money into BTC, just to try it out. I used some of it to buy food from a Dutch delivery service that accepted bitcoin at the time. I left the rest of the funds in the wallet and moved on.

Yesterday I checked that wallet address on a public explorer and saw that the leftover coins have grown in value a lot, way more than I expected.

Here's what I still have:  
I know the bitcoin address.  
I have the old-style recovery phrase (18 words, not 12).  
I also still have the original login ID (with dashes), my password, and access to the email I used back then.  
I do not have the private key.

When I log into the website now, it shows my BTC address, but the balance is zero. I assume the new interface isn't compatible with the older type of wallet I had. It offers to generate a private key, but from what I understand that won't help recover the old funds.  
I’ve read that some people managed to recover similar wallets using offline tools (written in Python maybe?), but I’m not sure which ones are safe or appropriate for this case.

Sort of true, but an oversimplification.

Price movement depends on **both the number of buyers** ***and*** **the total BTC volume they seek to purchase**, as well as willingness to sell, market conditions (liquidity, competing supply/demand, external factors like tax day coming). 

So if 1000 people could want to buy .0001 BTC each, or 10 people could want to buy 10 BTC each, it's unlikely the more people (1000 people) demand would drive the price up more than the less people (10 people) demand due to the total volume.

This is not necessarily true for any asset. And especially not true for Bitcoin.
Bitcoin supply can be reduced when folks burn coins intentionally or lose their keys.

It's price is currently measured in USD, which itself  does not have fixed supply or demand. Thus the value of USD is variable. Anything measured in value relative to the USD can have wild price fluctuations without any trading of the inverse commodity.

https://preview.redd.it/ryn0up2ze0ff1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=532102920fe4036ef85d276308013f502e0bdfad

**Here's what's featured in this week's issue:**

* Jito Lab's Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM)
* Sanctum's Launches Gateway Transaction Control Center
* Snipost Code Snippet Hub for Solana developers
* QuickNode Introduces Webhooks
* Realms Releases v2 Governance Hub for Solana DAOs. 

# 📦 Jito Block Assembly Marketplace

Jito Lab's BAM is a proposed block-building system for Solana that adds privacy, verifiability, and programmability to transaction sequencing without changing the base protocol.

BAM lets developers control and prove the ordering of their transactions privately so they can prevent toxic MEV and guarantee better execution for things like CLOBs and perps.

https://preview.redd.it/j3f77ah0f0ff1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b057385b6b51acf05271c7647e6213c4847899e

BAM processes a transaction by sending it first to a BAM Node, where it is filtered and ordered inside a Trusted Execution Environment. The node may insert transactions produced by a Plugin, then emits a cryptographic attestation of the final sequence. 

A BAM Validator running the updated Jito-Solana client executes that sequence and returns an attestation confirming it followed the instructions. These attestations are published, creating a public audit trail of ordering behavior.

BAM is composed of three core components that handle scheduling, execution, and customization:

* **BAM Nodes**: Scheduler nodes in TEEs that keep ordering private until execution and produce ordering proofs.
* **BAM Validators**: Validators using the upgraded client to execute node-provided bundles and attest to correct execution.
* **Plugins**: Programmable interfaces for custom sequencing logic that can collect fees.

Jito Labs will operate the first BAM Nodes. An initial set of alpha validators includes Triton One, SOL Strategies, Figment, Helius, and others. 

Early applications are already designing and testing Plugins. The near-term plan is to expand the operator set, grow the BAM Validator share toward roughly 30 percent of stake, and open source the code later in 2025, along with SDKs and tooling.

# 🚚 Sanctum Gateway

Sanctum's Gateway is a transaction control center that lets teams manage how their Solana transactions are optimized and delivered, improving inclusion rates and fee efficiency without changing application code.

https://preview.redd.it/akye3om1f0ff1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=014df8293abb37c9772ea34739c53e5c4ee97a8d

Gateway runs in two stages: 

1. **Optimize:** Gateway API converts raw payloads into sign-and-send-ready transactions, simulating usage, setting compute budgets, and calculating fees. 
2. **Delivery:** Simultaneously routes transactions across multiple channels (RPCs, Triton, Jito Bundles, and others) to maximize the chance of landing, while handling priority fees and Jito tips.

Gateway was built by Sanctum with the newly acquired Ironforge team. Sanctum will operate the service, offering “integrate once, optimize anytime” so teams can adjust execution behavior through the dashboard rather than code changes.

Projects that depend on timely, cost-effective inclusion can ship faster and keep performance stable as demand spikes.

# 🔖 Snipost Code Snippet Hub

Snipost is a new SocialFi platform for Solana developers to document code, share work, and earn rewards in SOL. Developers can showcase progress, learn from real projects, and monetize contributions through tips and challenges.

https://preview.redd.it/08rjnnv4f0ff1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=494158d133a42aa1eca31c32be58ae73cda5c704

  
Developers create content in two formats. 

1. **Snippet Editor**: Captures a function or small block of code with a brief explanation. 
2. **Snap Editor**: Turns a build or concept into slide-style visuals. 

Posts are searchable by tag, date, or topic, with actions that include forking, commenting, bookmarking, and mentioning other developers. 

Snipost is live and the team positions it as a complement to GitHub and formal docs, not a replacement. Future growth centers on more curated content, challenges, and community-driven learning.

[**Snipost**](https://snipost.vercel.app/start?ref=blog.colosseum.com)

# 🔔 QuickNode Webhooks

QuickNode Webhooks is a serverless, pay-per-match alert tool that pushes filtered onchain events directly to your URL. 

Instead of running WebSocket listeners or custom indexers, you configure a webhook in the dashboard, point to an endpoint, and start receiving data immediately. 

Events are pushed to your endpoint the moment they match, with automatic retries and ordering that handle chain reorganizations so each payload arrives exactly once.

Pricing is pay-per-match so you only spend credits when your filter actually fires. Empty blocks or non-matching events cost nothing.

Webhooks make it easy to build trading bots, contract or wallet monitors, or real-time alerts without having to stitch together separate data feeds or infrastructure.

# 🗳️ Realms v2

Realms v2 is a faster, cleaner governance hub for Solana DAOs.

https://preview.redd.it/0kgyk8x6f0ff1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2be5f0c7916d8c3e9a86aa831e1c7fd0ab93573b

Each DAO now has a single headquarters page that surfaces Proposals, an Overview, Treasury, an Activity Leaderboard, and Program Upgrades without buried tabs or missing context. 

Voting includes participation heat maps so communities can see who voted, who didn’t, and how voting power moved on chain, making governance more transparent.

Key features:

* Unified DAO HQ with core modules (proposals, treasury, activity, upgrades)
* Participation heat maps for proposal votes
* Lightning-fast, structured UI built to scale

Roadmap items include profiles, achievements, and better discovery to make governance more visible and engaging. Access is gated for now and users can try it with the (limited) code **ENTERV2.**

Realms positions this release as the start of a more versatile governance layer on Solana.

Solana,"I lost €16k trading meme coins. I feel trapped, alone, and I don’t know what to do anymore.","I’m 35, single, no real friends, and for the past 2 years I’ve been deep into trading meme coins. At one point, I was up over €100,000. I thought I had figured it out — that maybe this was finally my break, my way out of a life that already felt pretty empty.

But I didn’t take profits. I held, I chased, I got greedy — or maybe just hopeful. And now it’s all gone.

Worse, I’ve gone below zero. I’ve lost €16,000 of my own savings trying to win it back. I kept thinking, *“Just one more trade… I’ll recover it.”* But it’s just spiraled. I feel like I can’t stop. I’m not even trading to win anymore — I’m trading because I don’t know what else to do with myself.

I know I should stop. People say it all the time. But stopping feels worse than losing — because then I have to face everything else in my life: the loneliness, the time I’ve wasted, the fact that I might have to start over with nothing.

I’m not here for sympathy — I just needed to say this out loud to someone, somewhere. If anyone out there has been through this or is in it now, I’d appreciate hearing from you. Even if you don’t know what to say.

Nearly everyone investing in crypto lost at some point. My advise would be stop chasing, stop trading and just start dca into bitcoin. Time in the market beats timing the market. You are still young and have enough time to make money!

Start new life and forget about memes its real gambling. No one will ever build a real life on gambling. U better start now (i know its hard) or regret after one year and found your self in more deep shit than it is now.. So act quickly no time to waste on gambling start something real something u love to do find a problem and build a product to solve that... Good luck 🤝

The dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubed

Listen my man the exact feelings you mentioned is the exact same thing with gambling at the casinos (including online casinos). It all falls into the gambling category. Here is what happened: You had luck early on and did not realize how lucky you really were. You take it for granted. Same thing with the casino, someone starts spinning slots $2 a spin and hits for $6000. Based on everything you said this is a gambling addiction. You have to look at it this way: If you won the $100,000 and didn’t have this insane losing streak you would have just stayed in the never ending stressful cycle. Win lose win lose lose win lose win lose. It took a big loss for you to feel defeated. This is your chance to get out feeling so crushed. Trust me, get out. No more high risk meme trades however you did it. A similar thing happened to me with the online casinos. I would go down several thousand but then always somehow made a comeback. I fell for their algorithms that give me just enough to stay playing. This went on for 4-5 years straight. You don’t realize how much the roller coaster drains you mentally and how the dopamine is re-wiring your brain. The thing that made me quit was a crushing loss. That’s the worst mistake they ever made. They took me for $10,000 in two days. This was enough for me to say this is when I quit. It’s ruining my life. In your case it doesn’t seem like you are there just yet because you are mentioning possibly trying to make it back still flipping memes. I am trying to save you that step do not. I am so far past the gambling cycle I was in that now when I think about it… someone couldn’t even hand me $5000 cash to go and get started again. I wouldn’t want to go through it again. Take this as the best lesson ever learned and your way out from gambling with memes. As the days and weeks go by you start feeling better and better. You seem pretty smart: Start investing for real and you will have your $16,000 in the blink of an eye. Create a portfolio and label it “Money I didn’t spend on memes”. Keep investing every penny into it going forward. You will wake up every morning and look at that balance and it will fulfill that emptiness as the balance gets bigger and bigger. Be smart learn when to take profits. I’ve been there and used gambling and making money thinking I had a system that works to balance all of the bad things going on in my life. Pick up a new hobby. Start a business, learn to program, start working out, become a beast at investing the right way. You got this man!

Sorry to hear that man but a lil advice when you trade meme coins you gotta think that the money you put into that is already gone 

Trading meme coins is gambling theres no winning on that one 

Start a new life forget about it go to rehabilitation center if you have to

I've been there. Not with trading, but with life. And trust me, I think I know exactly how you feel. No hope, nothing in sight for the future. I was 50 when I fell into that rut. But for some reason, I just kept going. 12 years later after 5 years of development, I'm getting ready to launch my what I hope to be my last project. It took a long time,  too long,  but here I am,  still swinging and on the cusp of breaking out. If I can do it 60, i KNOW you can do it in your 30's. Never give up my friend.

Solana,Are Meme Coins Still Worth Launching on Solana in 2025?,"Solana quickly became the go-to chain for launching fast, low-cost meme tokens
But as we’re in 2025, is it still worth creating meme coins on Solana, or has the hype peaked?
Let’s be real. The golden age of DOGE and SHIB may have set the blueprint and Coins like BONK, WIF, and MYRO proved that the meme meta is still very much alive.Curious to hear from devs, traders, and degen investors is it still worth the effort to build one, or is the meta shifting to something else? Because as a dev two years ago making meme coins was one the hottest things. Now I see that there's not a lot of market left. As a dev, you could spin up a token on Solana, and if the meme was strong enough, it could blow up overnight.But now, things feel different.The market seems more saturated.Hype cycles are shorter.As someone who has built and launched before, I’m debating whether to jump back into the meme coin game or focus on something else entirely.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1manlpk/are_meme_coins_still_worth_launching_on_solana_in/,21,2025-07-27 14:25:09,"WARNING:

Jump back in. Alt season might come soon, so no reason not to.

What would you want out of creating a new coin?

Anything trending that’s is holding at the moment is good. 
Tik tok trend tokens 
Ai tokens 
You just have to look 

Note not all are the same you have too look at things like socials website etc. if it has a good marketcap but no activity in socials I wouldn’t touch it or if I did I would go in fully expecting to loose it. 

Solana is far better place for memes

you’ll find more opportunities in Solana with memes than you would on ETH or BNB imo.

WOW the APR that I get on Binance for SOL is 7% when I stake. What platform you using?
---
You need to keep enough left over to pay the network fee. This is one of the very first things you learn.

What you do is transfer SOL to the wallet so you can unstake. You staked like $18 of SOL for 2 days and didn’t even earn anything on it.  What are you even trying to do?
---
It’s 18$c just wait
---
Your available amount is less than lowest amount required
---
Calm the farm! This is the reason why I do well with crypto because of these emotional yolo types. So thanks for that.

It just takes a bit but looks like you’re unstaking too soon why not just leave it? I got a number of sol via staking

yep, the 7.79% likely includes both the JupSOL staking yield \*and\* extra yield from the Save pool. so you’re stacking returns, not getting 7.79% on top of JupSOL. makes sense if you're okay with the extra risk from the lending side
---
I had the same question, turns out that 7.79% is just the regular staking yield from the underlying SOL via JupSOL. It’s not like you’re stacking extra yield on top, it’s just a more automated way of holding it and earning that rate without managing validators yourself

PSOL - is liquid staking token with represents stake to Jupiter validator.   
Disadvantage  
\- you stake to one validator only.  
\- there is less opportunities use PSOL in DeFi then JitoSOL for example.

advantage - this validator offers high APY   


PSOL is not the worth LST but I personally prefer JitoSOL as the most tradable LST
---
What apy do are they offering? And what does your cold storage run currently
---
JitoSol is the better option (if you ask me). All benefits in… it’s close to 15%. Plus, you’re basically betting on the Solana Chain, helping it work well, and getting rewarded for that.
---
not really, advantage would be going with another lst like inf for an APY nearer to 10% or looping for APY over 20%
---
Phantom offering PSOL for staking? Mobile staking just got spicy
---
I stake in phanton with native staking with an apy 7.65% is it good or is stil better psol?
---
Native stake - Pick a validator from https://stakewiz.com/

Make sure it’s one with 0% commission across the board, it means that validator is making its money from the block rewards only (usually validators with over 300k in stake). You can still claim MEV from these validators, there are stake tools on https://cogentcrypto.io/app#stake-accounts to help claim earned MEV from MEV/Jito validators.

If you want to support the network, pick a validator with good uptime an a competitive commission, like 5% inflation commission and 8-10% MEV commission. Helping new validators get going is great for the ecosystem and helps decentralize stake! Just be mindful of their uptime, you can setup alerts through stakewiz.com for delinquency. If they’re down a lot then you can move your stake around to another validator.

If you want to do LSTs - there are a bunch of stake pools to help contribute to for small to mid level validators too. 

If you’re all about maxing APY or lazy, JITO sol is the best bet.
---
I've tried both, and with Phantom it's easier straight from the wallet, without moving tokens. Plus, PSOL seems like an interesting bonus.

Speed and fees and users

Decentralized Finance is building on ETH, I wouldn't discount that. If the banks and finance companies are building on it, it will thrive. L2 has addressed the fees, and ETH is more decentralized and arguably better for smart contracts because of that. 

Don't get me wrong, I own a decent amount of SOL (190), but I own ETH too and feel more bullish about ETH's recent price action. 

I think they will both do well. I own SUI too.

Be more specific. In your needs so I can best design a solution. Post your website for reference as well (if you're comfortable making that info public) but yeah tell me more.
---
If only you could downvote this more..
---
It's actually really hard to launch a legitimate token. All crypto tokens are just popularity contests. That's just what gives the token value (more people buying in). So you really need good marketing. Plus a lot of the Rugs that your hear about, aren't done by the creator of the token but by whales who buy in early and dump when they have a good profit.

You can add external value, if you have a successful business, by buying and burning the token (sending the tokens to the dead address), and that would be a big draw for long term investors. If you distribute anything like dividends, the token would be considered a security in the USA and you could get in trouble. Buy and burn programs are ok, and transaction rewards are ok (because they don't directly come from your business). You can use something like ""distributesol dot io"" (which is pretty new) to launch a token that has reward distributions.
---
Hey OP — you’re onto something powerful.

If you do this right, your memecoin can fuel site membership growth, create viral loops, and even attract outside investors. Here’s your quickstart guide — no fluff, just fire:

⸻

🔧 EASIEST WAY TO LAUNCH A MEMECOIN ON SOLANA TO SUPPORT YOUR BUSINESS:

1. Use Solana Token Creator by Soltools (no code required)
	•	Go to: https://soltools.xyz/token-creator
	•	Set:
	•	Token Name / Symbol (make it meme-worthy and sticky)
	•	Supply: Start with 1B or 69B (degen style) — but consider locking 70% in a vesting contract
	•	Decimals: 6 is standard
	•	Enable Freeze Authority if you want to maintain early control
	•	Click “Create Token” — you’ll pay in SOL gas (few cents max)

2. Airdrop your token to your website members
	•	Hook into your site’s backend (use Phantom Wallet login via Solana Wallet Adapter)
	•	Reward members with coins monthly or per interaction (login, share, comment, etc)
	•	This gives utility AND stickiness

3. List on Jupiter / Raydium (DEXs)
	•	Use https://jup.ag/token-list to apply for visibility
	•	Use https://raydium.io/liquidity to create a liquidity pool (just pair a small amount of SOL with your coin)
	•	Add a 2% tax if you want to fund dev/marketing (but only if done right)

4. Set Tokenomics That Don’t Suck
	•	🔒 Lock liquidity (use Solana Locker)
	•	🧻 Burn some supply
	•	🧑‍💻 Post your wallet address & dev wallet transparently
	•	💸 Allocate a small % for site operations (explain clearly)

5. Community + Hype Engine
	•	Drop updates on Twitter/X, Solana Reddit, and Telegram
	•	Post every week: airdrop stats, growth charts, memes
	•	Meme contests = free marketing

6. Use the Coin for Discounts + Access
	•	“Hold 10K coins = free access to VIP content”
	•	Let them use the token to unlock new features, badges, or merch
	•	Do NOT gate everything — let it enhance, not restrict

⸻

🧠 Final Alpha:

Your meme coin becomes legit when it’s tied to actual usage + trust. A coin that gets you into something real is more valuable than 99% of coins with no utility.

Pair your coin with actual benefits on your site, and you can 10x growth just from people wanting in on the joke… and the future upside.

You’re not just launching a coin — you’re building a community-powered ecosystem.

If you want I can drop a prebuilt Solana token script + NFT style access logic for your site. LMK.

⸻

🔥 Good luck — and remember: memes + utility = unstoppable combo on Solana.

u/cogent_crypto (well known High performance validator) has a revenue share (paid out in SOL) through their Cogent Cog NFT’s. Easily outperforms staking yields and has plenty of upside as things like block rewards and delegated stake increases. If you do your due diligence on Cogent, you’ll see their potential as a validator! 

They have a validator profit calculator (a widely popular tool used in the ecosystem by other validators and those looking to become one) that can be used to determine payouts at any time depending on current and theoretical metrics.

why don't just loop an lst and get APY nearer to 20% + future airdrops for using protocols?

You can use [BananaGun Pro](https://pro.bananagun.io) \- it already has sniping features on Solana and filters for memecoins, plus direct support on Discord. This way, you'll understand how DEX swaps work and can build your bot based on that later.
---
You can just use Axiom - see in my bio on X (attached to my profile here)
---
You might as well just trade on an exchange. There are definitely some that allow you to create dca bot orders for buying / selling at different levels. Kind of pointless to do it on chain when exchanges are available and probably easier to execute for small amounts.
---
Best way to make it yourself would be to chat with an AI about it (chatgpt, Gemini, grok, Claude, etc.). Use that to teach you about how it should work and what features you want. Then use something like vscode with Roo-Code extension, Claude code, or Replit, to actually code it. 

Keep in mind, having it as a discord bot adds a whole extra layer of complications. Your bot will likely be python, or Javascript and use an RPC to talk to the blockchain. To use it as a discord bot, you will need to host it (you can host from your own PC) and you would have to code the discord component as well.
---
You should rather use the existing telegram bots, will save you a ton of headache. Don’t go for your own bot unless you are aiming for speed and efficiency. 

Development of such bots is a world of stone and thorns.

It was always the reason. 

Your source of trust me bro “market structure” and “analytics” Is hilarious
---
lol… at its peak of the Solana price, pump was generating more fees than ETH, not sol, pump. 

What’s your theory? I intricately understand capital market dynamics, let’s hear your full take not just what you think it’s not.
---
It definitely affects it, insane amount of people started to buy sol to yolo into memes.

Pump company also affects it directly(negatively) by dumping huge amounts of sol they get from users to fund their company and founders.
---
So trump launching a token had nothing to do with SOL price?
---
Since many people are misunderstanding my point, here’s my point of view explained further:

I say that the market structure was bullish when SOL was at 40 dollars, what we’ve seen is that one of the suggested target movings was exactly hit, that pump fun also got to glory at the same time is just a another thing, Sol saw hype so did pumpfun, not pumpfun saw high so saw sol. SOL is the beginning of pumpfun and SOL is the ending of pumpfun, people shouldn’t think that if pumpfun dies SOL will also die
---
Pump sells massive amounts of Solana every pump.

Explain to me like I’m 5 how one entity dumping 1 million Solana(not dollars) doesn’t impact the price
---
Bro what are you smoking that absolutely was the reason it ever got that high. People needed to buy SOL to swap into memecoins. That was the literal value prop.
---
no way, an unironic solana economist?
---
People losing a lot of money will change their activity and sentiment. Although there’s not a direct line from pumps price to sol price, there is a direct line to mood. Had people made money, even if a small amount, they’d be exiting to sol, trading more possibly, etc. I’m not someone who’d qualify for the airdrop because I don’t meme, but their lack of clarity or airdrop and silence is equal to the feeling of wearing wet socks.",-0.5719,Negative,0.4803,Positive

>**2/** Two key concepts driving this transformation:

>Market Microstructure: The “rules of the game” for trading on any venue. Small rule changes = massive improvements in user outcomes.

>Application-Controlled Execution (ACE): Apps get control over HOW and WHEN transactions execute (instead of validators controlling this)





>**3/** ELI5: Why should everyday Solana users care?Simple: These changes reduce friction for traders.

>Developers can build better apps

>Traders get more reliable execution and better prices.



>**4/** For builders, this represents a major change.

>Previously: Choose between Solana’s network effects OR app chain flexibility

>Now: Get BOTH with ACE. All the control of your own chain + all the users and liquidity of Solana mainnet.



>**5/** Practical examples of what this enables:

>Derivatives exchanges with complex message types

>Perpetuals (perps) trading with much better UX



>**6/** This doesn’t change Solana’s core mission - it AMPLIFIES it. Solana was founded to build a platform for on-chain exchange. Critics said monolithic blockchains couldn’t match app chain flexibility. Turns out they were wrong.



>**7/** How will we know it’s working? 

>Early signal: Renewed excitement among buildersLong-term metrics:

>\-Fees generated

>\-Open interest

>\-Trading volume



>**8/** Bottom line: Solana is positioning itself as THE destination for serious on-chain trading and DeFi. Better tools for builders = better experiences for users = more liquid, efficient markets for everyone. The future of internet capital markets is being built on Solana.

This deep dive offers some seriously compelling insights into the ecosystem's performance. The raw growth numbers are impressive, especially the multi-fold increase in half-yearly revenue – it really speaks to the network's adoption and capability to handle increasing economic activity.

The significant share of revenue coming from the rapid iteration and trading of new assets is certainly striking. It highlights how effectively the chain’s foundational strengths, like incredibly low transaction costs and high throughput, enable truly active and high-volume user engagement, even if it's concentrated in a specific area right now. This is a clear market fit for a certain type of demand.

What I find particularly fascinating is the DApp 'revenue efficiency' metric, where applications are retaining more than twice the network's fees. This is a powerful signal for builders: it demonstrates that there's substantial economic value to be captured at the application layer, beyond just base network usage. It truly incentivizes innovation and sophisticated business models on top of the protocol.

It's also great to see the sustained, if smaller, growth in sectors like physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) and the payments ecosystem. These areas, alongside robust activity in decentralized finance, show a healthy, albeit still developing, diversification. It suggests that while one category might be driving a large portion of the current revenue, the underlying infrastructure is attracting a wide range of builders across different use cases.

Someone posts one of these almost every day. The OP is always 15. The idea is to get people to donate in DMs. Scam.

Buy your SOL on axiom.pro then send from axiom.pro wallet to phantom wallet

Just be careful of anyone dm’ing u. Most likely a scammer

Well you could either look for someone that’s close to you that can sell you either solana or usdc ( then swap it to sol) or there are similar website to hodlhodle but I have never tried them before so idk their legitimacy

You don’t have any bitcoin machine close to you ?

You don't that's it just it 

You either give them your card info and do kyc or you find another trustworthy adult to do it for you. Otherwise everybody that's going to meet you in the DMS here is just going to scam you

Imagine being such a baby and shit trader that you have to open a law suit to try and get your 1.1 sol back you aped into some shitter on new pairs called cumqueefadoor that was bundled 98% but you didn’t take the time to research and just threw 1.1 sol in at a 20k mc and get rugged 

No crying at the casino, carry on.

It’s a class action lawsuit brought by ambulance chasers. They will make everyone they can think of in it. Pretty confident we are fine.

Probably I imagine they’ve got a pretty serious legal team who has thought through all this shit

Haven’t they been hit with lawsuits before?
