Larger price swings than an unspecified level, in an unspecified direction.  


Thank you, analyst.
---
I have little doubt that Bitcoin will rise higher, but TA is never a guarantee. There's always too many unknown variables in crypto
---
tldr; Bitcoin surged above $119,000, nearing $120,000, as it rebounded from two-week lows around $114,500. Analysts highlighted key levels, with $119.5K and $120K as critical resistance points for further upward movement. Liquidation clusters and exchange order-book liquidity suggest potential price swings between $113.6K and $121K. Market participants anticipate heightened volatility, with short liquidations potentially exceeding $1.1 billion if Bitcoin challenges its all-time high near $123,000.

All this shit is so they can default on the debt and still be rich. It won't work though.
---
tldr; The GENIUS Act, recently passed in the U.S., aims to reshape the stablecoin landscape by separating interest-bearing stablecoins from payment-focused ones. This regulatory clarity is expected to drive innovation in payment services and 'killer apps,' with companies like Mastercard, PayPal, and Polygon exploring new use cases such as cross-border payments and micropayments. The act aligns U.S. regulations closer to the EU's MiCA framework and emphasizes utility over yield, fostering adoption in real-world commerce and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)

* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Common Bitcoin Myths

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

Bitcoin,God Candle painting,"Hey guys! Another Bitcoin painting in the streets for the first to take it home. 
This painting represents more than price action. It represents an awakening. The sense that something new and inevitable is rising non stop, not by force, but by consensus.
I chose to leave this piece at the Cristo Rei because it stands as a powerful symbol of faith. For a long time, I struggled with religion. I rejected it. But today, I no longer fight it. I’ve made peace with it. I respect those who believe, and I acknowledge the transformative power that faith can have, even if I don’t fully share it nor understand it. Hope you like it.

I do 2/3 Multi Sig all with metal backups (and passwords with easy hints in my notes for each password) + worse case scenario already have a fully signed transaction that sends my whole bag to River (which has my beneficiaries) 

Self custody with extra paranoia + extra insurance. Wouldn’t have it any other way. Certainly would sooner trust myself with this system than the government or a bank
---
It is insane. I think about this a lot. 

Everyone here has forgotten a password before. Everyone here has needed to reverse a transaction before.

With Bitcoin, there is ZERO tolerance for error. Yes, that’s what makes it secure. And yes, that’s what makes it unrealistic for many people to own. They want the ‘fraud protection’. 

We’ve all been there before. I’m hoping there’s a way in the future to maintain this security and decentralization while allowing SOME reversibility. Honestly, it’ll increase adoption and become even more valuable. 
---
Same if you had cash and it’s lost, stolen or burned up. It breeds personal responsibility.
---
Not insane… That’s the whole point of a decentralized system. 

It’s also not erased as the ledger holds the record of your transactions $.. it’s just stuck on the blockchain without a key.

It’s a whole lot better to rely on yourself than to rely on banks, people, or services to hold onto YOUR money. 
What stops banks, people or services from going under or getting hacked or having their data wiped? That can’t happen with blockchain and you are solely responsible. No one to blame, no one to ask when you need access to your money.
---
This is why you have your back up words. If you lose those as well, use anchor watch or a similar service. If you fuck that up, well, thanks for the donation 😂. Also Bitcoin fuctions this way because it's the one asset you can truly, beyond a reason of doubt, own. This is not so for all other assets.
---
I’d argue the value isn’t lost; the value of lost coins is transferred to all the other coins in circulation when supply is restricted.

That's why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan now keep custody of your Bitcoin for fees.

The headline is clickbait, and the writer is a ""stubborn nocoiner"" as he calls himself in the article. The article is critical of the Citi report on Bitcoin, though the writer also has limited understanding of Bitcoin itself. Both ignore that it's just a superior asset to everything else out there. It's wonderful that 17 years after invention, Bitcoin still remains so misunderstood by the mainstream.

**Here's what's featured in this week's issue:**

* Jito Lab's Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM)
* Sanctum's Launches Gateway Transaction Control Center
* Snipost Code Snippet Hub for Solana developers
* QuickNode Introduces Webhooks
* Realms Releases v2 Governance Hub for Solana DAOs. 

# 📦 Jito Block Assembly Marketplace

Jito Lab's BAM is a proposed block-building system for Solana that adds privacy, verifiability, and programmability to transaction sequencing without changing the base protocol.

BAM lets developers control and prove the ordering of their transactions privately so they can prevent toxic MEV and guarantee better execution for things like CLOBs and perps.

https://preview.redd.it/j3f77ah0f0ff1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b057385b6b51acf05271c7647e6213c4847899e

BAM processes a transaction by sending it first to a BAM Node, where it is filtered and ordered inside a Trusted Execution Environment. The node may insert transactions produced by a Plugin, then emits a cryptographic attestation of the final sequence. 

A BAM Validator running the updated Jito-Solana client executes that sequence and returns an attestation confirming it followed the instructions. These attestations are published, creating a public audit trail of ordering behavior.

BAM is composed of three core components that handle scheduling, execution, and customization:

* **BAM Nodes**: Scheduler nodes in TEEs that keep ordering private until execution and produce ordering proofs.
* **BAM Validators**: Validators using the upgraded client to execute node-provided bundles and attest to correct execution.
* **Plugins**: Programmable interfaces for custom sequencing logic that can collect fees.

Jito Labs will operate the first BAM Nodes. An initial set of alpha validators includes Triton One, SOL Strategies, Figment, Helius, and others. 

Early applications are already designing and testing Plugins. The near-term plan is to expand the operator set, grow the BAM Validator share toward roughly 30 percent of stake, and open source the code later in 2025, along with SDKs and tooling.

# 🚚 Sanctum Gateway

Sanctum's Gateway is a transaction control center that lets teams manage how their Solana transactions are optimized and delivered, improving inclusion rates and fee efficiency without changing application code.

https://preview.redd.it/akye3om1f0ff1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=014df8293abb37c9772ea34739c53e5c4ee97a8d

Gateway runs in two stages: 

1. **Optimize:** Gateway API converts raw payloads into sign-and-send-ready transactions, simulating usage, setting compute budgets, and calculating fees. 
2. **Delivery:** Simultaneously routes transactions across multiple channels (RPCs, Triton, Jito Bundles, and others) to maximize the chance of landing, while handling priority fees and Jito tips.

Gateway was built by Sanctum with the newly acquired Ironforge team. Sanctum will operate the service, offering “integrate once, optimize anytime” so teams can adjust execution behavior through the dashboard rather than code changes.

Projects that depend on timely, cost-effective inclusion can ship faster and keep performance stable as demand spikes.

# 🔖 Snipost Code Snippet Hub

Snipost is a new SocialFi platform for Solana developers to document code, share work, and earn rewards in SOL. Developers can showcase progress, learn from real projects, and monetize contributions through tips and challenges.

https://preview.redd.it/08rjnnv4f0ff1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=494158d133a42aa1eca31c32be58ae73cda5c704

  
Developers create content in two formats. 

1. **Snippet Editor**: Captures a function or small block of code with a brief explanation. 
2. **Snap Editor**: Turns a build or concept into slide-style visuals. 

Posts are searchable by tag, date, or topic, with actions that include forking, commenting, bookmarking, and mentioning other developers. 

Snipost is live and the team positions it as a complement to GitHub and formal docs, not a replacement. Future growth centers on more curated content, challenges, and community-driven learning.

# 🔔 QuickNode Webhooks

QuickNode Webhooks is a serverless, pay-per-match alert tool that pushes filtered onchain events directly to your URL. 

Instead of running WebSocket listeners or custom indexers, you configure a webhook in the dashboard, point to an endpoint, and start receiving data immediately. 

Events are pushed to your endpoint the moment they match, with automatic retries and ordering that handle chain reorganizations so each payload arrives exactly once.

Pricing is pay-per-match so you only spend credits when your filter actually fires. Empty blocks or non-matching events cost nothing.

Webhooks make it easy to build trading bots, contract or wallet monitors, or real-time alerts without having to stitch together separate data feeds or infrastructure.

# 🗳️ Realms v2

Realms v2 is a faster, cleaner governance hub for Solana DAOs.

https://preview.redd.it/0kgyk8x6f0ff1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=2be5f0c7916d8c3e9a86aa831e1c7fd0ab93573b

Each DAO now has a single headquarters page that surfaces Proposals, an Overview, Treasury, an Activity Leaderboard, and Program Upgrades without buried tabs or missing context. 

Voting includes participation heat maps so communities can see who voted, who didn’t, and how voting power moved on chain, making governance more transparent.

Key features:

* Unified DAO HQ with core modules (proposals, treasury, activity, upgrades)
* Participation heat maps for proposal votes
* Lightning-fast, structured UI built to scale

Roadmap items include profiles, achievements, and better discovery to make governance more visible and engaging. Access is gated for now and users can try it with the (limited) code **ENTERV2.**

Realms positions this release as the start of a more versatile governance layer on Solana.

Solana,"I lost €16k trading meme coins. I feel trapped, alone, and I don’t know what to do anymore.","I’m 35, single, no real friends, and for the past 2 years I’ve been deep into trading meme coins. At one point, I was up over €100,000. I thought I had figured it out — that maybe this was finally my break, my way out of a life that already felt pretty empty.

But I didn’t take profits. I held, I chased, I got greedy — or maybe just hopeful. And now it’s all gone.

Worse, I’ve gone below zero. I’ve lost €16,000 of my own savings trying to win it back. I kept thinking, *“Just one more trade… I’ll recover it.”* But it’s just spiraled. I feel like I can’t stop. I’m not even trading to win anymore — I’m trading because I don’t know what else to do with myself.

I know I should stop. People say it all the time. But stopping feels worse than losing — because then I have to face everything else in my life: the loneliness, the time I’ve wasted, the fact that I might have to start over with nothing.

I’m not here for sympathy — I just needed to say this out loud to someone, somewhere. If anyone out there has been through this or is in it now, I’d appreciate hearing from you. Even if you don’t know what to say.

How does the number one rule always get looked past, never invest money you can’t afford to lose 100% of

Nearly everyone investing in crypto lost at some point. My advise would be stop chasing, stop trading and just start dca into bitcoin. Time in the market beats timing the market. You are still young and have enough time to make money!

Start new life and forget about memes its real gambling. No one will ever build a real life on gambling. U better start now (i know its hard) or regret after one year and found your self in more deep shit than it is now.. So act quickly no time to waste on gambling start something real something u love to do find a problem and build a product to solve that... Good luck 🤝

The dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubed

Listen my man the exact feelings you mentioned is the exact same thing with gambling at the casinos (including online casinos). It all falls into the gambling category. Here is what happened: You had luck early on and did not realize how lucky you really were. You take it for granted. Same thing with the casino, someone starts spinning slots $2 a spin and hits for $6000. Based on everything you said this is a gambling addiction. You have to look at it this way: If you won the $100,000 and didn’t have this insane losing streak you would have just stayed in the never ending stressful cycle. Win lose win lose lose win lose win lose. It took a big loss for you to feel defeated. This is your chance to get out feeling so crushed. Trust me, get out. No more high risk meme trades however you did it. A similar thing happened to me with the online casinos. I would go down several thousand but then always somehow made a comeback. I fell for their algorithms that give me just enough to stay playing. This went on for 4-5 years straight. You don’t realize how much the roller coaster drains you mentally and how the dopamine is re-wiring your brain. The thing that made me quit was a crushing loss. That’s the worst mistake they ever made. They took me for $10,000 in two days. This was enough for me to say this is when I quit. It’s ruining my life. In your case it doesn’t seem like you are there just yet because you are mentioning possibly trying to make it back still flipping memes. I am trying to save you that step do not. I am so far past the gambling cycle I was in that now when I think about it… someone couldn’t even hand me $5000 cash to go and get started again. I wouldn’t want to go through it again. Take this as the best lesson ever learned and your way out from gambling with memes. As the days and weeks go by you start feeling better and better. You seem pretty smart: Start investing for real and you will have your $16,000 in the blink of an eye. Create a portfolio and label it “Money I didn’t spend on memes”. Keep investing every penny into it going forward. You will wake up every morning and look at that balance and it will fulfill that emptiness as the balance gets bigger and bigger. Be smart learn when to take profits. I’ve been there and used gambling and making money thinking I had a system that works to balance all of the bad things going on in my life. Pick up a new hobby. Start a business, learn to program, start working out, become a beast at investing the right way. You got this man!

Sorry to hear that man but a lil advice when you trade meme coins you gotta think that the money you put into that is already gone 

Trading meme coins is gambling theres no winning on that one 

Start a new life forget about it go to rehabilitation center if you have to

I've been there. Not with trading, but with life. And trust me, I think I know exactly how you feel. No hope, nothing in sight for the future. I was 50 when I fell into that rut. But for some reason, I just kept going. 12 years later after 5 years of development, I'm getting ready to launch my what I hope to be my last project. It took a long time,  too long,  but here I am,  still swinging and on the cusp of breaking out. If I can do it 60, i KNOW you can do it in your 30's. Never give up my friend.

WOW the APR that I get on Binance for SOL is 7% when I stake. What platform you using?
---
You need to keep enough left over to pay the network fee. This is one of the very first things you learn.

What you do is transfer SOL to the wallet so you can unstake. You staked like $18 of SOL for 2 days and didn’t even earn anything on it.  What are you even trying to do?
---
It’s 18$c just wait
---
Calm the farm! This is the reason why I do well with crypto because of these emotional yolo types. So thanks for that.
---
It just takes a bit but looks like you’re unstaking too soon why not just leave it? I got a number of sol via staking
---
Your available amount is less than lowest amount required
---
You might be better off asking r/trustwallet

🔒 2 days lock-in — just enough to regret it halfway through

Solana,Are Meme Coins Still Worth Launching on Solana in 2025?,"Solana quickly became the go-to chain for launching fast, low-cost meme tokens
But as we’re in 2025, is it still worth creating meme coins on Solana, or has the hype peaked?
Let’s be real. The golden age of DOGE and SHIB may have set the blueprint and Coins like BONK, WIF, and MYRO proved that the meme meta is still very much alive.Curious to hear from devs, traders, and degen investors is it still worth the effort to build one, or is the meta shifting to something else? Because as a dev two years ago making meme coins was one the hottest things. Now I see that there's not a lot of market left. As a dev, you could spin up a token on Solana, and if the meme was strong enough, it could blow up overnight.But now, things feel different.The market seems more saturated.Hype cycles are shorter.As someone who has built and launched before, I’m debating whether to jump back into the meme coin game or focus on something else entirely.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1manlpk/are_meme_coins_still_worth_launching_on_solana_in/,19,2025-07-27 14:25:09,"WARNING:

yep, the 7.79% likely includes both the JupSOL staking yield \*and\* extra yield from the Save pool. so you’re stacking returns, not getting 7.79% on top of JupSOL. makes sense if you're okay with the extra risk from the lending side
---
I had the same question, turns out that 7.79% is just the regular staking yield from the underlying SOL via JupSOL. It’s not like you’re stacking extra yield on top, it’s just a more automated way of holding it and earning that rate without managing validators yourself",0.1341,Positive,0.7833,Positive
Solana,Any advantage of staking with phantom vs Jupiter?,So far i have been staking with Jupitor+Jito from cold wallet. Today there was a notification on phantom app that I can stake with Phantom and get PSOL. How does it work? It also mentions that the staking will be non-custodial(as if I were staking from cold wallet).,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1ma0f2l/any_advantage_of_staking_with_phantom_vs_jupiter/,12,2025-07-26 18:21:44,"WARNING:

PSOL - is liquid staking token with represents stake to Jupiter validator.   
Disadvantage  
\- you stake to one validator only.  
\- there is less opportunities use PSOL in DeFi then JitoSOL for example.

advantage - this validator offers high APY   


PSOL is not the worth LST but I personally prefer JitoSOL as the most tradable LST
---
What apy do are they offering? And what does your cold storage run currently
---
JitoSol is the better option (if you ask me). All benefits in… it’s close to 15%. Plus, you’re basically betting on the Solana Chain, helping it work well, and getting rewarded for that.
---
not really, advantage would be going with another lst like inf for an APY nearer to 10% or looping for APY over 20%
---
Phantom offering PSOL for staking? Mobile staking just got spicy
---
I stake in phanton with native staking with an apy 7.65% is it good or is stil better psol?

Robinhood is at 7.35%",0.3313,Positive,0.9862,Positive
